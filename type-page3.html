      <p><div class="one"> &#60;Man, the <span class="green">imperfect librarian,</span> may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi;&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="two"> &#60;the universe, with its <span class="red">elegant endowment</span> of shelves, <span class="red">of enigmatical volumes,</span> of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="three"> &#60;and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the <span class="green">work of a god.</span> To perceive the distance between the <span class="green">divine and the human,&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="four"> &#60;it is enough to compare these <span class="red">crude wavering symbols which my <span class="green">fallible hand scrawls</span> on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside:&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="five"> &#60;punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.&sol;&#62;</div></p>

      <p><div class="six">&#60;Second: <span class="green">The orthographical symbols</span> are twenty-five in number.^ &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="seven">&#60;This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library&sol;&#62;</div></p>

      <p><div class="nine"> &#60;the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="ten"> &#60;One which my father saw in a hexagon on <span class="green">circuit fifteen ninety-four</span> was made up of the letters MCV,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eleven"> &#60;perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere <span class="red">labyrinth of letters,&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="twelve"> &#60;but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="thirteen"> &#60;there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, <span class="green">verbal jumbles and incoherences. &sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="fourteen"> &#60;(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians <span class="red">repudiate the vain and superstitious custom</span> of finding a meaning in books&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="fifteen"> &#60;and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the <span class="green">chaotic lines of one's palm...</span> &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="sixteen"> &#60;They admit that the <span class="green">inventors of this writing</span> imitated the twenty-five natural symbols,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="seventeen"> &#60;but maintain that this application is accidental and that <span class="red">the books signify nothing in themselves.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
