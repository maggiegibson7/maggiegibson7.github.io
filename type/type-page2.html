    <p><div class="one">&#60;now that my eyes can <span class="green">hardly decipher</span> what I write,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="two">&#60;I am preparing to die just a few leagues <span class="red">from the hexagon</span> in which I was born.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="three">&#60;Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the <span class="green">fathomless air;</span> &sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="four">&#60;my body will sink endlessly and decay and <span class="red">dissolve in the wind</span> generated by the fall, which is infinite.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="five">&#60;I say that the Library is unending. <span class="green">The idealists</span> argue that the <span class="green">hexagonal rooms</span> are a necessary form of absolute space or,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="six"> &#60;at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="seven"> &#60;(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a <span class="green">circular chamber</span> containing a great circular book,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="eight"> &#60;whose spine is continuous and which follows the <span class="red">complete circle of the walls;</span> but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="nine"> &#60;This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum:&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="ten"> &#60;The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose <span class="green">circumference</span> is inaccessible.&sol;&#62; </div></p>

    <h4><div class="eleven">&#60;There are <span class="green">five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls;</span> each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format;&sol;&#62;</div></h4>
    <p><div class="twelve"> &#60;each book is of <span class="green">four hundred and ten pages</span> each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters <span class="red">which are black in color.</span>&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="thirteen"> &#60;There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="fourteen"> &#60;I know that this <span class="green">incoherence at one time</span> seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its <span class="green">tragic projections,</span>&sol;&#62;</div></p>
    <p><div class="fifteen"> &#60;is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to <span class="red">recall a few axioms.</span>&sol;&#62;</div></p>
