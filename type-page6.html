    <h1><span class="green">&#60;Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works.&sol;&#62;</span></h1>
    <h2><span class="red"> &#60;They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books.&sol;&#62;</span></h2>
    <h3> &#60;Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts.&sol;&#62;</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
    <div class="paragraph-one">
      <p><div class="one"><span class="green"> &#60;One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="two"> &#60;The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="three"><span class="green"> &#60;but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="four"> &#60;Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <P><div class="five"><span class="green"> &#60;They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical. &sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
    <div class="paragraph-two">
      <p><div class="six">&#60;<span class="red">We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="seven"> &#60;On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eight"> &#60;In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="nine"><span class="red"> &#60;Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="ten"> &#60;How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity...&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eleven"> &#60;In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago!&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="twelve"><span class="red"> &#60;- may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="thirteen"> &#60;Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="fourteen"> &#60;They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="fifteen"><span class="red">&#60;These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="sixteen"> &#60;In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="seventeen"> &#60;It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eighteen"><span class="red"> &#60;These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="nineteen"> &#60;I cannot combine some characters which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="twenty"> &#60;No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="twenty-one"><span class="red">&#60;To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="twenty-two"> &#60;(An n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="twenty-three"> &#60;You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)&sol;&#62;</div></p>
