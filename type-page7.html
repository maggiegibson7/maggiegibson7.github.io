      <p><div class="one"><span class="green"> &#60;Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="two"> &#60;I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="three"> &#60;Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.&sol;&#62;</div></p>

      <p><div class="four"><span class="red">&#60;I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="five"> &#60;Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="six"> &#60;Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="seven"> &#60;I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order).&sol;&#62;</div></p>

      <h3>Translated by J. E. I.</h3>
      <p><div class="nine"> One. The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.) </div></p>
      <p><div class="ten"> Two. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian. </div></p>
      <p><div class="eleven"> Three. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.</div></p>
      <p><div class="twelve"> Four. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.</div></p>
