                    <h3>Paytas has worked as a stripper multiple times throughout her life, and it continues to inform her content. Based off her autobiography, it seems she worked at multiple clubs throughout LA between 2006 and 2010.</h3>
                    <div class="sources">
                        <p>“…I started working at a second club in Van Nuys. This was a ghetto club, all ethnic girls. I was the only white girl working there. I always dressed in baggy and ugly clothes so they wouldn’t steal anything from me. I never drove my car because I wanted them to think I had nothing, like them, so they wouldn’t feel intimidated by me. I know they were though.”[1]</p>
                        <p>“When I performed onstage at these clubs, I felt like a star. Everyone waited for me to get offstage to they could talk to me, dance with me.”[2]</p>
                        <p>“This was the club I thrived at the most because it was mainly full of minorities, both dancers and customers. I was the only white girl working at the club, which meant I was a rare gem.”[3]</p>

                        <p>Her mother has been married five times throughout her life, and engaged in a long custody battle with Paytas’s father after the selling of his previous company for millions of dollars. [3]</p>

                <div class="sources" >
                    <p>Paytas has historically been open about her history with plastic surgery; she admits to having filler, breast augmentation, liposuction, and a Brazilian butt lift. She has stated, “There’s no one body part of me that is real.” [1, 2]</p>
                    <p>She’s also stated that she “loves the blow-up sex doll look.” [3]</p>
                    <p>She has stated in the past that she has suffered from anorexia and bulimia, then denied it, and also has claimed to be a sufferer of body dysmorphia. [4]</p>
                    <p>Her book, “Curvy and Loving It” (2014), is a rambling attempt at a self-help book, described on the cover to be “a no-nonsense guide to loving your body, curves and all, this uplighting collection shares all the tips and advice that Paytas herself uses when it seems the world is trying to get her down.”</p>
                    <p>Paytas has an OnlyFans and has stated that 70% of their income derives from it, accruing approximately one million dollars a year. [5]</p>

                    <p>Paytas’s numerous times coming out; as a chicken nugget, as a man, and non-binary. She now uses she/they pronouns. [1]</p>
                    <p>She once ‘came out’ as black, cosplayed as a black slave, and has used racial slurs towards black people on multiple occasions. [2, 3, 4]</p>
