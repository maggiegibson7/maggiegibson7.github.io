      <p><div class="seven">&#60;Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines.&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eight"><span class="red"> &#60;He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century,&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="nine"> &#60;the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="ten"><span class="green">&#60;The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="eleven"> &#60;These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="twelve"><span class="red">&#60;This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="thirteen"> &#60;He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="fourteen"><span class="green">&#60;From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations&sol;&#62;</span></div><p>
      <p><div class="fifteen"> &#60;of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): &sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="sixteen"><span class="red">&#60;Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues,&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
      <p><div class="seventeen"> &#60;the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel,&sol;&#62;</div></p>
      <p><div class="eighteen"><span class="green"> &#60;the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.&sol;&#62;</span></div></p>
