      <h3>Information</h3>
      <details>
          <summary>Summary</summary>
          <p>In this project, I am attempting to make a cohesive database of NYC mutual aid organizations that attempts to eliminate unconscious bias by users.</p>
        </details>

          <summary>What is mutual aid?</summary>
          <p>Mutual aid is normally defined by being horizontal collaboration on a local scale, similar to many grassroots organizations. A good rule of thumb when trying to figure out if something is mutual aid or charity, is whether you yourself could benefit from said organization or your donation. A good example is donating to a local mutual aid bail fund, so if you yourself get arrested, the fund you donated may be used to bail you out! Additionally, mutual aid tends to focus on specific issues within your local community; unlike charities, who donate to larger causes/issues or research.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What are the requirements to be in the database?</summary>
          <p>The group or organization must be local to NYC, and must be a mutual aid organization. Any organization that is geared towards philanthropy, fighting a cause, or utilizes a top-down administrative structure does not qualify. In order to qualify as mutual aid, a grassroots model must be utilized, with emphasis on solidarity and direct and outward accountability to those it serves.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What makes this database different?</summary>
          <p>This database attempts to eliminate any unconscious bias in the individual process of choosing which mutual aid to allocate funds to. Unconscious bias may occur based on location, popularity, or function of mutual aid groups. This database seeks to take away the concept of choice when supporting, and asks the user to focus on the concepts of solidarity and mutual aid instead, serving the 'greater good' instead of choosing familiarity.</p>
