      <p>   &#60;The universe (which others call the <span class="green">Library</span>) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of <span class="red">hexagonal</span> galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. &sol; &#62; </p>
      <p>   &#60;From any of the <span class="green">hexagons</span> one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors.&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;The distribution of the galleries is <span class="red">invariable.</span>&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, <span class="green">scarcely exceeds</span> that of a normal bookcase.&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, <span class="green">identical to the first and to all the rest.&sol;&#62;</span></p>
      <p>   &#60;To the left and right of the hallway <span class="red">there are two very small closets.&sol;&#62;</span></p>
      <p>   &#60;In the first, <span class="green">one may sleep standing up;</span> in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities.&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;Also through here passes a <span class="green">spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards</span> to remote distances.&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;In the hallway there is a mirror which <span class="red">faithfully duplicates all appearances.&sol;&#62;</span></p>
      <p>   &#60;Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library <span class="red">is not infinite</span> (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... &sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;Light is provided by some <span class="green">spherical fruit</span> which bear the name of lamps.&sol;&#62;</p>
      <p>   &#60;There are two, transversally placed, <span class="red">in each hexagon.&sol;&#62;</span></p>
      <h4>   &#60;The light they emit is insufficient, incessant. </h4>
