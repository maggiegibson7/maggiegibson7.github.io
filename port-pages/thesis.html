    <h2>Trisha Paytas and White Feminism</h2>
    <div id="descr">
    <p>Trisha Paytas & White Feminism is a website that combines illustration and interaction to create an immersive world where traditional feminine visual motifs have been subverted. Utilizing a maximalist and ornamental web design approach, the database is designed to guide the user through the learning experience about the online life of Trisha Paytas and examining how their journey to capitalistic success was reliant on exploitation of marginalized peoples, through a postmodern feminist lens. </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>     The intention is to illustrate and draw attention to the fraught relationship between privileged white women and marginalized peoples and it is depicted in media and online spaces. Trisha Paytas has simultaneously painted themselves as a victim and a self-made success story, when in reality they have attained their financial success through exploitation and bigotry, using harmful comments and rhetoric to garner exposure and clicks through controversy. </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>     I like to think of my project as rebuttal against white liberal feminism; that empowerment for women does not come through financial success and enforcement of strict gender binaries. The ideologies that I believe in and utilize are post-structuralist and intersectional feminisms that serve to imagine a world where we empower ourselves through community, fulfillment without need for capital, and genuine care for those around us. In a time where social media and online spaces churn out increasingly exploitative and reductive archetypes for women to attempt to box themselves into, I hope to portray the lifestyle and story that Paytas performs becomes doubly harmful and dehumanizing.</p>
